<h2>About</h2>
<p>This app created by James Graham, Tyson Green and Anh Truong. We wanted to create a dynamic interactive playlist that would utilize spotify and allow users to add songs to a playlist and users would decide what song would play next.</p>

<p>We have all been to a party, gathering or function where everyone fights for the auxillary cable or there is a pause in the music because the aux cable is being reconnected to another device. It's 2016 and there should be a way to have all the music under one aux cable! That's why we decided to make OneAux</p>

<p>Users are also able to vote up or down on songs to decide the next track. Spotify is required to make this work and Spotify premium will prevent ads. The person signed into Spotify will also be able to have the playlist saved so they can remember and share the playlist!</p>

  <h2> Lets get the party started with OneAux!</h2>
