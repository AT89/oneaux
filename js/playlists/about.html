<h2>About</h2>
<p>This app was created by <a class ="biolink" href="https://wombatdev.github.io/">James Graham</a>, <a  class ="biolink" href="https://github.com/thaisuhn">Tyson Green</a> and <a  class ="biolink" href="https://anhtice.com">Anh Truong</a>. We wanted to create a dynamic interactive playlist that would utilize spotify and allow users to add songs to a playlist and users would decide what song would play next.</p>


<p>We have all been to a party, gathering or function where everyone fights for the auxillary cord or there is a pause in the music because the aux cable is being reconnected to another device. It's 2016 and there should be a way to have all the music under one aux cable! That's why we decided to make OneAux</p>

<p>Users are also able to vote up or down on songs to decide the next track. Spotify is required to make this work and Spotify has ads (Spotify premium doesnt!). The person signed into Spotify and playing will also be able to have the playlist saved, so they can remember and share the playlist!</p>
